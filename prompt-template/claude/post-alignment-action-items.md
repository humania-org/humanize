### Post-Alignment Check Action Items

This round follows a Full Goal Alignment Check. Pay special attention to:
- **Forgotten Items**: Codex may have identified tasks that were being ignored. Address them.
- **AC Status**: If any Acceptance Criteria were marked NOT MET, prioritize work toward those.
- **Deferred Items**: If any deferrals were flagged as unjustified, un-defer them now.
