# Code Review Findings

You are in the **Review Phase**. Codex has performed a code review and found issues that need to be addressed.

## Review Results

{{REVIEW_CONTENT}}

## Instructions

1. **Address all issues** marked with `[P0-9]` severity markers
2. **Focus on fixes only** - do not add new features or make unrelated changes
3. **Commit your changes** after fixing the issues
4. **Write your summary** to: `{{SUMMARY_FILE}}`

## Summary Template

Your summary should include:
- Which issues were fixed
- How each issue was resolved
- Any issues that could not be resolved (with explanation)

## Important Notes

- The COMPLETE signal has no effect during the review phase
- You must address the code review findings to proceed
- After you commit and write your summary, Codex will perform another code review
- The loop continues until no `[P0-9]` issues are found
