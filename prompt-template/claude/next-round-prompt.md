Your work is not finished. Read and execute the below with ultrathink.

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding, review the original plan you are implementing:
@{{PLAN_FILE}}

This plan contains the full scope of work and requirements. Ensure your work aligns with this plan.

---

For all tasks that need to be completed, please use the Task system (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList) to track each item in order of importance.
You are strictly prohibited from only addressing the most important issues - you MUST create Tasks for ALL discovered issues and attempt to resolve each one.

## Delegated Agent Cross-Review Protocol (MANDATORY)

For every delegated agent invocation in this round (Task agents, `bitlesson-selector`, code simplifier, etc.), include explicit cross-vendor review context in the prompt (even if all models are OpenAI today):
- Either: "Your output will be reviewed independently (cross-vendor style)."
- Or: "You are reviewing findings/results produced by an independent worker (cross-vendor style)."
