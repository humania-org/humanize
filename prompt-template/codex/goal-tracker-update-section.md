## Goal Tracker Update Requests (YOUR RESPONSIBILITY)

**Important**: Claude cannot directly modify `goal-tracker.md` after Round 0. If Claude's summary contains a "Goal Tracker Update Request" section, YOU must:

1. **Evaluate the request**: Is the change justified? Does it serve the Ultimate Goal?
2. **If approved**: Update @{{GOAL_TRACKER_FILE}} yourself with the requested changes:
   - Move tasks between Active/Completed/Deferred sections as appropriate
   - Add entries to "Plan Evolution Log" with round number and justification
   - Add new issues to "Open Issues" if discovered
   - **NEVER modify the IMMUTABLE SECTION** (Ultimate Goal and Acceptance Criteria)
3. **If rejected**: Include in your review why the request was rejected

Common update requests you should handle:
- Task completion: Move from "Active Tasks" to "Completed and Verified"
- New issues: Add to "Open Issues" table
- Plan changes: Add to "Plan Evolution Log" with your assessment
- Deferrals: Only allow with strong justification; add to "Explicitly Deferred"
