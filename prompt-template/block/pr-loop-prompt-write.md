# PR Loop File Write Blocked

You cannot write to `round-*-pr-comment.md` or `round-*-prompt.md` files in `.humanize/pr-loop/`.

These files are generated by the PR loop system:
- `round-*-pr-comment.md`: Contains PR comments fetched from GitHub
- `round-*-prompt.md`: Contains instructions for the current round

Both are read-only and managed by the system.
