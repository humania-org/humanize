# Unpushed Commits Detected

You are trying to stop, but you have **{{AHEAD_COUNT}} unpushed commit(s)** on branch `{{CURRENT_BRANCH}}`.

Since `--push-every-round` is enabled, you must push your commits before exiting.

**Required Action**:
```bash
git push origin {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
```

After pushing all commits, you may attempt to exit again.
