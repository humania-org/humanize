# Incomplete Todos Detected

You are trying to stop, but you still have **incomplete todos**:

{{INCOMPLETE_LIST}}

**Required Action**:
1. Complete all remaining todos before attempting to stop
2. Mark each todo as completed using the TodoWrite tool
3. Only after ALL todos are completed, you may proceed to write your summary and stop

Do NOT proceed to Codex review until all todos are finished. This saves time and ensures thorough work.
