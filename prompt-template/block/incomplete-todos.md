# Incomplete Tasks Detected

You are trying to stop, but you still have **incomplete tasks**:

{{INCOMPLETE_LIST}}

**Required Action**:
1. Complete all remaining tasks before attempting to stop
2. Mark each task as completed:
   - For items showing `(Task #...)`: use the **TaskUpdate** tool (set status to "completed")
   - For items without Task ID: use the **TodoWrite** tool (set status to "completed")
3. Only after ALL tasks are completed, you may proceed to write your summary and stop

Do NOT proceed to Codex review until all tasks are finished. This saves time and ensures thorough work.
