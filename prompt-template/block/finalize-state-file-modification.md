# Finalize State File Modification Blocked

You cannot modify `finalize-state.md`. This file is managed by the loop system during the Finalize Phase.

The Finalize Phase is the final step before loop completion. Focus on:
1. Running the code-simplifier agent
2. Committing your changes
3. Writing your finalize summary to `finalize-summary.md`
