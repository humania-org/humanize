# Goal Tracker Not Initialized

You are in **Round 0** and the Goal Tracker has not been properly initialized.

**Missing items in `{{GOAL_TRACKER_FILE}}`**:
{{MISSING_ITEMS}}

**Required Actions**:
1. Read `{{GOAL_TRACKER_FILE}}`
2. Replace placeholder text with actual content:
   - Extract or define the **Ultimate Goal** from your understanding of the plan
   - Define 3-7 specific, testable **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Populate **Active Tasks** with tasks from the plan, mapping each to an AC
3. Write the updated goal-tracker.md

**IMPORTANT**: The IMMUTABLE SECTION can only be set in Round 0. After this round, it becomes read-only.

After updating the Goal Tracker, you may attempt to exit again.
