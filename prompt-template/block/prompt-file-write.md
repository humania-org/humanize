# Prompt File Write Blocked

You cannot write to `round-*-prompt.md` files.

**Prompt files contain instructions FROM Codex TO you (Claude).**

You cannot modify your own instructions. Your job is to:
1. Read the current round's prompt file for instructions
2. Execute the tasks described in the prompt
3. Write your results to the summary file

If the prompt contains errors, document this in your summary file.
