CRITICAL - Work Completion Requirements
===========================================

When you complete your work, you MUST:

1. Write your resolution summary to:
   {{RESOLVE_PATH}}

   The summary should note:
   - This is Round 0 awaiting initial bot reviews
   - No issues to address yet

2. Try to exit - the Stop Hook will poll for bot reviews

DO NOT comment on the PR to trigger review - the bots will
review automatically since this is a new PR.

The Stop Hook will poll for bot reviews.
