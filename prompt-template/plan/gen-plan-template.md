# <Plan Title>

## Goal Description
<Clear, direct description of what needs to be accomplished>

## Acceptance Criteria

Following TDD philosophy, each criterion includes positive and negative tests for deterministic verification.

- AC-1: <First criterion>
  - Positive Tests (expected to PASS):
    - <Test case that should succeed when criterion is met>
    - <Another success case>
  - Negative Tests (expected to FAIL):
    - <Test case that should fail/be rejected when working correctly>
    - <Another failure/rejection case>
  - AC-1.1: <Sub-criterion if needed>
    - Positive: <...>
    - Negative: <...>
- AC-2: <Second criterion>
  - Positive Tests: <...>
  - Negative Tests: <...>
...

## Path Boundaries

Path boundaries define the acceptable range of implementation quality and choices.

### Upper Bound (Maximum Acceptable Scope)
<Affirmative description of the most comprehensive acceptable implementation>
<This represents completing the goal without over-engineering>
Example: "The implementation includes X, Y, and Z features with full test coverage"

### Lower Bound (Minimum Acceptable Scope)
<Affirmative description of the minimum viable implementation>
<This represents the least effort that still satisfies all acceptance criteria>
Example: "The implementation includes core feature X with basic validation"

### Allowed Choices
<Options that are acceptable for implementation decisions>
- Can use: <technologies, approaches, patterns that are allowed>
- Cannot use: <technologies, approaches, patterns that are prohibited>

> **Note on Deterministic Designs**: If the draft specifies a highly deterministic design with no choices (e.g., "must use JSON format", "must use algorithm X"), then the path boundaries should reflect this narrow constraint. In such cases, upper and lower bounds may converge to the same point, and "Allowed Choices" should explicitly state that the choice is fixed per the draft specification.

## Feasibility Hints and Suggestions

> **Note**: This section is for reference and understanding only. These are conceptual suggestions, not prescriptive requirements.

### Conceptual Approach
<Text description, pseudocode, or diagrams showing ONE possible implementation path>

### Relevant References

## Dependencies and Sequence

### Milestones
1. <Milestone 1>: <Description>
   - Phase A: <...>
   - Phase B: <...>
2. <Milestone 2>: <Description>
   - Step 1: <...>
   - Step 2: <...>

<Describe relative dependencies between components, not time estimates>

## Implementation Notes

### Code Style Requirements
- Implementation code and comments must NOT contain plan-specific terminology such as "AC-", "Milestone", "Step", "Phase", or similar workflow markers
- These terms are for plan documentation only, not for the resulting codebase
- Use descriptive, domain-appropriate naming in code instead
