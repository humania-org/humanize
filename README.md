# Humanize

**Current Version: 1.15.2**

> Derived from the [GAAC (GitHub-as-a-Context)](https://github.com/SihaoLiu/gaac) project.

A Claude Code plugin that provides iterative development with independent AI review. Build with confidence through continuous feedback loops.

## What is RLCR?

**RLCR** stands for **Ralph-Loop with Codex Review**, inspired by the official ralph-loop plugin and enhanced with independent Codex review. The name also reads as **Reinforcement Learning with Code Review** -- reflecting the iterative cycle where AI-generated code is continuously refined through external review feedback.

## Core Concepts

- **Iteration over Perfection** -- Instead of expecting perfect output in one shot, Humanize leverages continuous feedback loops where issues are caught early and refined incrementally.
- **One Build + One Review** -- Claude implements, Codex independently reviews. No blind spots.
- **Ralph Loop with Swarm Mode** -- Iterative refinement continues until all acceptance criteria are met. Optionally parallelize with Agent Teams.

## How It Works

The loop has two phases: **Implementation** (Claude works, Codex reviews summaries) and **Code Review** (Codex checks code quality with severity markers). Issues feed back into implementation until resolved.

## Install

```bash
# Add humania marketplace
/plugin marketplace add humania-org/humanize
# If you want to use development branch for experimental features
/plugin marketplace add humania-org/humanize#dev
# Then install humanize plugin
/plugin install humanize@humania
```

Requires [codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) for review. See the full [Installation Guide](docs/install-for-claude.md) for prerequisites and alternative setup options.

## Quick Start

1. **Generate a plan** from your draft:
   ```bash
   /humanize:gen-plan --input draft.md --output docs/plan.md
   ```

2. **Run the loop**:
   ```bash
   /humanize:start-rlcr-loop docs/plan.md
   ```

3. **Monitor progress**:
   ```bash
   source <path/to/humanize>/scripts/humanize.sh
   humanize monitor rlcr
   ```
